# Asca-Search_engin


the description
It was a test project in software engineering, I was the team leader , we were three developers who worked together, where a search engine was developed (in the form of a simple form) that uses public API technology to access modern and accurate data (web interfaces and the search agent runs Javascript codes), the idea is Overcoming the results displayed by the regular search engine, which are often multiple. Therefore, it was a solution in addressing the limitations in the existing search engines.
Development year: 2021-2022

Challenges:
- Restrictions on the number of requests made per day.
- A new idea, so there is no complete understanding of it, because its aim was to create an application that might in the future be a competitor to search engines

future business:
We are working on integrating a database and (web background) to manage the data flow process, also re-working on interface design.

We hope you like it
